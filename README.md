# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository. This project showcases my profile, experience, skills, and selected works in software engineering. The portfolio is designed to be clean, artistic, responsive, and easy to navigate, serving both as a personal branding platform and a technical demonstration.

The main goals of this project are:

* To present my profile in a professional and structured manner
